## About Exploratory Data Analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing and summarizing datasets, with the goal of discovering patterns, anomalies, and other insights that can inform further analysis and modeling efforts.

EDA typically involves visualizing data using plots and graphs, as well as statistical summaries and tests to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

The goal of EDA is not to confirm preconceived notions or hypotheses, but rather to explore the data and let it lead the analysis in new and potentially unexpected directions.

EDA is an important first step in any data analysis project, as it helps to get a sense of the structure and characteristics of the data, identify any problems or issues that need to be addressed, and inform the direction of further analysis.

## Here are the basic steps of any EDA project.
1. Select the real-world data set from Kaggle.
2. Download and read the file using Pandas.
3. Select the required columns from the dataset.
4. Perform data preparation and cleaning using Pandas and NumPy.
5. Plot interactive graphs using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and WordCloud.
6. Ask and Answer interesting questions from the dataset.
7. Summarize your work and provide a conclusion. Ideas for future work
8. Summarize your work and provide conclusion.
